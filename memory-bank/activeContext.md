# Active Context: Job Board API

## Current Focus

- **Phase**: Phase I (Core Setup & Basic CRUD).
- **Immediate focus**: Memory bank initiated from PRD; next step is implementation per `tasks-phase1.md` (PR #1: project setup, Docker, migrations, app factory).

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank created from full PRD: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- No code changes yet; repository contains only PRD and Phase I task breakdown.

## Next Steps

1. Execute Phase I per `tasks-phase1.md`: PR #1 (setup, Docker, config, migrations), then PR #2 (models, schemas), then PR #3 (repositories, services, DI, routes, error handling).
2. Verify Docker Compose, migrations, and Swagger UI before moving to Phase II.
3. When starting work: read `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` for scope and architecture; use `techContext.md` for stack and constraints.

## Active Decisions / Open Questions

- None yet. Follow PRD and Phase I tasks as source of truth until scope or tech choices are revisited.
